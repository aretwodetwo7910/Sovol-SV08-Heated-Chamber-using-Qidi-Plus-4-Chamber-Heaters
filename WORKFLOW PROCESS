BEFORE STARTING THE WORKFLOW PROCESS PLEASE READ THE OTHER DOCUMENTATION FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF ASSOCIATED RISKS AND PRECAUTIONS, PARTS/TOOLS NECESSARY AND HOW THE HEATERS FUNCTION. 

STEP 1:

START BY PRINTING PARTS REQUIURED AND TEST FITTING THEM TO YOUR PRINTER AND CHAMBER HEATERS. MODIFICATIONS MIGHT BE REQUIRED DUE TO SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN MANUFACTURING OF THE HEATERS AND THE PRINTER
-- (LINK FOR 3D PRINED PARTS HERE): 

STEP 2: 

REMOVE THE BACK COVER OF THE QIDI CHAMBER HEATERS AND REMOVE THE PTC HEATERS, INSTALL THE THERMAL FUSES TO THE PTC HEATERS USING A RIVET AND RIVET GUN USING THE FOLLOWING METHOD: 
THE CENTER TAB IS USED FOR MOUNTING THE THERMAL FUSE TO THE PTC HEATER. CUT THE RED WIRE AND REMOVE THE WIRE CLIP FROM THE CENTER TAB, KEEP THE RUBBER SHEATH THAT GOES OVER THE TAB,
WE WILL USE THIS LATER, BEND DOWN THE CENTER TAB FLAT WITH THE PTC HEATER MAKING SURE THE TAB DOES NOT CROSS THE PTC BLOCK AND SHORT THE PTC HEATER, DRILL THROUGH THE PTC HEATER WITH 
A 1/8IN DRILL BIT AND CONFIRM RIVET BOTTOMS OUT WEHEN INSERTED INTO PTC HEATER BLOCK BUT DO NOT PERMANENTLY INSTALL RIVET AT THIS TIME. TAKE THE THERMAL FUSE AND COIL ONE LEG OF THE 
FUSE AROUND THE BASE OF THE RIVET, USING EDGE CUTTERS, CUT DOWN THE EXCESS OFF THE LEG BEING WRAPPED AROUND THE RIVET, THERE ONLY NEEDS TO BE ONE WRAP AROUND THE BASE OF THE RIVET, 
TOO MUCH AND THE RIVET MIGHT NOT SIT FAR ENOUGH INTO THE HEATER TO BE SECURED PROPERLY. MAKE SURE THE BODY OF THE FUSE IS NOT TOUCHING THE RIVET, JUST ONE LEG OF THE FUSE SHOULD BE 
TOUCHING THE BASE OF THE RIVET NOT THE BODY OF THE RIVET AT ALL AS THIS ALLOWS ANOTHER PATH FOR CURREENT TO FLOW! THERE IS NO RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE BODY OF THE FUSE AND THE LEGS OF 
THE FUSE SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL!! INSTALL THE RIVET WITH THE FUSE COILED UNDERNEATH AND CONFIRM RIVET IS SECURELY MOUNTED IN PLACE. BEFORE RIVET IS INSTALLED, CUT DOWN THE OTHER 
LEG OF THE FUSE AND CRIMP A NON INSULATED BUTT CONNECTOR TO IT REMAINING AMOUNT, THIS LEG WILL ATTACH TO THE FIBERGLASS RED SHEATHED WIRE THAT IS THE LINE VOLTAGE IN FOR THE HEATER. 
BLUE WIRES ARE FOR NEUTRAL AND DO NOT NEED TO BE MODIFIED. CAREFULLY BEND THE LEGS OF THE FUSE TO THE RIGHT POSITION TO ANGLE THEM TOWARDS THE PATH OF THE REST OF THE WIRING HARNESS.
ADD NON CONDUCTIVE THERMAL PASTE ON THE BODY OF THE FUSE AND THE BASE OF THE TAB/RIVET SO HEAT GETS PROPERLY ABSORBED INTO THE FUSE. CAREFULLY TAKE THE RUBBER SHEATH AND SLIDE IT DOWN 
OVER THE BODY OF THE FUSE TO INSULATE IT FROM ACCIDENTAL CONTACT WITH ANYTHING ELSE. BEFORE RE-INSTALLATION INTO THE CHAMBER HEATER BODY, RE-APPLY THERMAL PASTE TO THE THERMISTOR THAT 
IS KAPTON TAPED TO THE BODY SO THERE IS AN ACCURATE TEMPERATURE READING WHEN THE PTC HEATER IS POWERED ON. REINSTALL THE PTC CORE INTO THE HEATER BODY AND INSTALL THE COVER. 


STEP 3:

THE BASE PLATE/BOTTOM PLATE IDK WHAT TO CALL IT.. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SECURELY MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER USING SCREWS, DRILL HOLES IN THE GUSSETS OF THE PRINTER BOTTOM SIDE 
AT THE FRONT AND BACK OF WHERE THE BOTTOM PLATE ENDS NEAR EACH CORNER, ALTERNATIVELY, A HOLE PUNCH MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUNCH A HOLE THRU THE GUSSETS BUT I DID NOT DO IT THIS METHOD
FOR FEAR OF CRACKING THE GUSSETS. PUSH THE BOTTOM PLATE AGAINST THE PRINTER AND MARK WHERE THE HOLES WERE DRILLED THRU THE GUSSETS, FIND THE CORRECT HEAT SET THREADED INSERT AND DRILL
OUT AND INSTALL THREADED INSERTS WHERE THE MARKS WERE MADE THRU THE DRILLED HOLES ON THE GUSSETS, TEST FIT THE PIECE ONTO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER TO VERIFY HOLES WERE DRILLED PROPERLY. 
IF YOU WANT, SMALL TAP SCREWS CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF THREADED INSERTS TO ATTACH THE BOTTOM PLATE IF PARTS FOR OTHER METHODS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, THE PLATE JUST NEEDS TO BE SECURELY 
MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER AS THIS PLATE HOLDS THE SOLID STATE RELAYS AND KLIPPER EXPANDER HOW EVER YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO, THATS UP TO YOU. REFERENCE THE PICTURES PROVIDED IF YOU WOULD 
LIKE TO MOUNT THE SSR's AND KLIPPER EXPOANDER IN THE SAME ORIENTATION AS THIS GUIDE. 

STEP 4:

WITH THE BOTTOM PLATE REMOVED ONCE MORE TEST FIT THE SSR HEAT SINKS, MARK AND DRILL HOLES IN THE PRINTED PART AND SECURELY ATTACH THE HEATSINKS TO THE PLATE, DO THE SAME FOR THE KLIPPER 
EXPANDER MAKING SURE TO LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WIRING AND MICRO USB CONNECTION FOR THE KLIPPER EXPANDER. FOLLOW THE WIRING SCEMATIC PROVIDED TO CONNECT EVERYTHING TOGETHER IF YOU WANT TO
USE THE HEATED_CHAMBER.CFG FILE WITH OUT MODIFYIG ANY LINES OF CODE. 


STEP 5:

MODIFY THE PRINTER.CFG TO INCLUDE THE CHAMBER_HEATER.CFG AND PASTE THE HEATER CFG FILE INTO THE /CONFIG DIRECTORY. 

STEP 6: 

*****WITH THE HEATERS LIVE WIRES DICONNECTED!!!!!**** BENCH TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HEATER FANS AND THERMISTORS. VERIFY THEREMISTOR TEMPS ARE ACCURATE TO AMBIENT TEMP ON THE MACHINE DASHBOARD TAB
AND VERIFY FANS FUNCTION WHEN A SET TEMPERATUREE IS COMMANDED, YOU SHOULD SEE THE FANS START TO SPIN AND THE SSR'S SHOULD BE BLINKINGF FAST INDICATINMG THEY ARE DUTY CYCLING AND READY TO DELIVER POWER
TO THE HEATERS ONCE THE HEATER IS CONNECTED. TURN THE PRINTER OFF AND WHILE WEARING PPE, CAREFULLY CONNECT A 110V-220V POWER SOURCE (LIKE A CUT OFF EXTENSION CORD) CONNECTED TO THE HEATER LIVE WIRE AND THEN
THROUGH THE SSR'S, ONLY THE NEUTRAL WIRE FROM THE EXTENSION CORD SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE HEATER, THE LIVE WIRE WILL GO THRU THE 1 AND 2 TERMINALS ON THE LOAD SIDE OF THE SSR BEFORE CONNECTING TO THE HEATER.
PLUG IN THE END OF THE EXTENSION CORD INTO A POWER STRIP WITH THE POWER STRIP IN THE OFF POSITION. TURN THE PRINTER BACK ON AND FLIP THE SWITCH TO THE POWER STRIP AND WATCH CAREFULLY TO VERIFY COMPONENTS 
HAVE BEEN CONNECTED PROPERLY.. (CHECK FOR MAGIC SMOKE) THE KLIPPER EXPANDER SHOULD LIGHT UP BUT THE SSR SHOULD NOT, THEN COMMAND THE HEATER TO OPERATE AT A SPECIFIED TEMPERATURE. MAKE SURE THE FANS KICK ON 
AS SOON AS THETEMPERATURE IS COMMANDED. IF NO MAGIC SMOKE IS PRESENT YOU SHOULD SEE THE SSR'S BLINKING NOW, THE KLIPPER EXPANDER BLINKING AND THE CHAMBER HEATER EXHAUST START TO PUSH HOT AIR. 

IT IS HIGHLY ADVISED TO TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THERMAL FUSES BY REMOVING THE TEMP LIMITS OF THE THERMISTOR IN THE CHAMBER_HEATER.CFG AND RUN THE HEATER AT 1.0 POWER, FORCING THE THERMAL FUSE TO REACH
ITS BREAK TEMPERATURE. WHEN I PERFORMED THIS TEST I FOUND THE THERMAL FUSE POPPED AT 110 DEG CELCIUS BASED ON THE THERMISTOR TEMP IN THE MACHINE DASHBOARD TAB ON ORCASLICER. YOU WILL HAVE TO DRILL OUT THE RIVET
AND RE-INSTALL A NEW FUSE BUT THIS IS WORTH WHILE TO CONFIRM YOU ARE SETTING UP THE THERMAL FUSE PROPERLY AND THE TEMPERATURE DROPS AFTER THE THERMAL FUSE BLOWS WHICH INDICATES THAT THE HEATERS ARE NOT RECEIVING 
ANY POWER AND VERIFIES THAT THE FUSE IS NOT SHORTING ACROSS THE BODY OF THE PTC HEATER.

IT IS ADVISED TO WATCH WEST 3D'S VIDEO ON THE QIDI CHAMBER HEATER HERE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO MESS WITH THIS STUFF -- (LINK): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6AB6ewnp1c

STEP 7: 
GET AN IDEA OF WHERE EXACTLY YOU WANT THE HEATERS PLACED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRINTER. YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LOCATION OF THE GANTRY AT ITS HOMING LOCATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE RAILS WHEN PRINTING 
A FIRST LAYER. I FOUND THAT THE QIDI CHAMBER HEATERS TEND TO BLOW AIR DOWNWARDS AND PUTTING THEM TOO LOW CAUSES ISSUES. I SETTLED FOR ABOUT
