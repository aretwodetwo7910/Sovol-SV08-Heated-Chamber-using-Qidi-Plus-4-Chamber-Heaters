BEFORE STARTING THE WORKFLOW PROCESS PLEASE READ THE OTHER DOCUMENTATION FOR FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS  ASSOCIATED, PARTS/TOOLS NECESSARY AND HOW THE HEATERS FUNCTION. 

START BY PRINTING PARTS REQUIURED AND TEST FITTING THEM TO YOUR PRINTER AND CHAMBER HEATERS. -- (LINK): 

REMOVE THE BACK COVER OF THE QIDI CHAMBER HEATERS AND REMOVE THE PTC HEATERS, INSTALL THE THERMAL FUSES TO THE PTC HEATERS USING A RIVET AND RIVET GUN. THE CENTER TAB IS USED FOR MOUNTING THE THERMAL FUSE TO THE PTC HEATER. REMOVE THE WIRE CLIP FROM THE CENTER TAB, BEND DOWN THE CENTER TAB FLAT WITH THE PTC HEATER MAKING SURE THE TAB DOES NOT CROSS THE 
PTC BLOCK AND SHORT THE PTC HEATER. 

THE BASE PLATE/BOTTOM PLATE IDK WHAT TO CALL IT.. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE SECURELY MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER USING SCREWS, DRILL HOLES IN THE GUSSETS OF THE PRINTER BOTTOM AT THE FRONT AND BACK OF THE PIECE NEAR EACH CORNER, ALTERNATIVELY, A HOLE PUNCH MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUNCH A HOLE THRU THE GUSSETS BUT I DID NOT DO IT THIS METHOD
FOR FEAR OF CRACKING THE GUSSETS. PUSH THE BOTTOM PLATE AGAINST THE PRINTER AND MARK WHERE THE HOLES WERE DRILLED THRU THE GUSSETS, FIND THE CORRECT HEAT SET THREADED INSERT AND DRILL OUT AND INSTALL THREADED INSERTS WHERE THE MARKS WERE MADE THRU THE DRILLED HOLES, TEST FIT THE PIECE ONTO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER TO VERIFY HOLES WERE DRILLED PROPERLY. 
IF YOU WANT, SMALL TAP SCREWS CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF THREADED INSERTS TO ATTACH THE BOTTOM PLATE IF PARTS FOR OTHER METHODS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, THE PLATE JUST NEEDS TO BE SECURELY MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRINTER AS THIS PLATE HOLDS THE SOLID STATE RELAYS AND KLIPPER EXPANDER.

REFERENCE THE PICTURES PROVIDED IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MOUNT THE SSR's AND KLIPPER EXPOANDER IN THE SAME ORIENTATION AS THIS GUIDE. 

WITH THE BOTTOM PLATE REMOVED ONCE MORE TEST FIT THE SSR HEAT SINKS, MARK AND DRILL HOLES IN THE PRINTED PART AND SECURELY ATTACH THE HEATSINKS TO THE PLATE, DO THE SAME FOR THE KLIPPER EXPANDER MAKING SURE TO LEAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE WIRING AND MICRO USB CONNECTION FOR THE KLIPPER EXPANDER.
