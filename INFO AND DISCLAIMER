THE PRINTER.CFG FILE ATTACHED IS A CONGLOMERATION OF DIFFERENT PRINTER.CFG FILES I HAVE FOUND FROM THOSE OF YOU IN THE COMMUNITY, PICKING AND PULLING DIFFERENT THINGS I LIKED ABOUT EACH AND ADDING THINGS OVER TIME. THE PRINTER.CFG FILE IS NOT PERFECT BUT SUITS MY NEEDS FOR WHAT I WANTED FROM THE SV08 AT THIS TIME.
I AM BY NO MEANS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, A PROGRAMMER OR SOME GENIUS ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE WORK I HAVE PUT DOWN HERE MAY HELP THOSE OF YOU AND GUIDE YOU TOWARDS INSTALLING A CHAMBER HEATER IN YOUR SV08. THE CHAMBER_HEATER.CFG FILE IS A REMIX OF THE FILE SHOWN IN YOUTUBE VIDEO BY WEST3D AND THEY GIVE A GOOD OVERALL
DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HEATER PROJECT. I AM NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WEST 3D BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THEM THANKS FOR THE IDEAS AND INSPIRATION FOR THIS PROJECT, I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU WATCH THEIR VIDEO HERE TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE HEATER AND ITS FUNCTION.
